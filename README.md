# Newsweek clone: Bootstrap

> In this project, I worked on making a whole website using the Bootstrap Framework. I worked on the elements we had seen previously such as Grid and Flexbox, and I included Media Queries to be able to make the website look exactly the same as the original for different screen sizes.
